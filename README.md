These are some small JS functions I use from time to time.

They are available for loading directly from GitHub via GitHub Pages (`https://alexcoder04.github.io/ac04.js/<filename>.js`).

|File|Functionality|
|---|---|
|`copy.js`|Add click event listener to a button which copies some text and switches the button text to "Copied!"|
|`ls-arr.js`|Storing and manipulating an array in `localStorage`|
|`tabs.js`|Preserving the last open tab in Bootstrap|
